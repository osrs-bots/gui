# GUI

This is a native application client that allows end users to interact with the botting packages.

## Installation

This project is built using [pyinstaller](^1^), a tool that converts Python applications into stand-alone executables.

To install pyinstaller, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

To create an executable file from your Python script, run the following command:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile your_script.py
```

This will generate a `dist` folder that contains the executable file.

## Usage

This project uses [tkinter](^2^), a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.

To run the application, double-click the executable file or run it from the command line:

```bash
./your_script.exe
```

This will open a graphical user interface that lets you interact with the botting packages.

## Download

The downloadable executable file can be found in the [latest releases](^3^) section of this repository.
